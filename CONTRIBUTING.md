# Contributing to FlexSeedScheme

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **FlexSeedScheme**, a more flexible and powerful version of Flutter's ColorScheme.fromSeed. Use multiple seed colors, custom chroma and tone mapping. We welcome contributions that fix bugs, introduce enhancements or new features, and correct API documentation errors or typos.

## How to contribute

Before you start working on your contribution, please follow these steps:

- Fork the repository on GitHub and clone your fork to your local machine.
- Create a new branch from the main branch and name it according to the type and scope of your contribution. For example, `fix/issue-123` or `feature/new-color-option`.
- Make your changes in the new branch, following the code style and conventions of the project.
- Write tests for your changes, using the existing test framework. Make sure your changes do not break any existing tests or decrease the test coverage of the project.
- Commit your changes with a clear and descriptive message, referencing any relevant issues or pull requests.
- Push your changes to your fork on GitHub and create a pull request against the main branch of the original repository.
- Wait for the maintainers to review your pull request and provide feedback or approval.

## What to contribute

We appreciate any contribution that improves the quality and functionality of the package. Here are some examples of what you can contribute:

- Bug fixes: If you find a bug in the package, please report it as an issue on GitHub and provide a fix if possible.

- Introduce breaking API changes **without** prior discussion and approval from the maintainers.
- Add little or no value to the package, such as stylistic or irrelevant updates in the samples that demonstrate usage of the package. Such contributions are unlikely to be merged, as they may cause unnecessary conflicts or maintenance issues.
- Violate the code of conduct or the license of the project.
