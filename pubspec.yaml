  # Flutter SDK from 2.10.0 stable also depends on this package.
  #
  # Flutter stable 3.7 uses 0.2.0, and Flutter beta 3.10.x and master are
  # locked to version 0.3.0. Since it is using 0-ver, it does not upgrade with
  # constraint ^0.2.0 to 0.3.x, only to 0.2.x. We must use this deviant constraint
  # to be able to use it with Flutter stable, beta and master. It works well because
  # version 0.3.0 is actually not breaking any 0.2.0 APIs, it only contains new
  # features and fixes.

  # Flutter does not expose the "@internal" annotation via foundation, to use it we need to
