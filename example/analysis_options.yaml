    # Consider using this lint rule if you are making a public Flutter package, for private ones and private apps
    # we recommend keeping it off as you probably won't be making diagnostic properties for all your
    # classes, unless you are using a data class lib that does it for you via code generation.

    # DO document all public members.
    #
    # https://dart-lang.github.io/linter/lints/public_member_api_docs.html
    #
    # All non-overriding public members should be documented with /// doc-style comments.
    # Not necessary for an app or the examples in a pub.dev package. I always enable this for
    # public packages.
    #
    # NOTE: There is also the lint rule "package_api_docs", that is enabled as well via all being enabled.
    # https://dart-lang.github.io/linter/lints/package_api_docs.html
    # "DO provide doc comments for all public APIs.", is what it is supposed to do, but only for packages.
    # However, if we turn OFF rule "public_member_api_docs", then the "package_api_docs" offers no warnings
    # on missing API doc comments alone. So our conclusion for now is that this rule has to be used instead
    # to ensure we find all APIs that should have documentation comments in a package as well.
