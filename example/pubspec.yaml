  # Color utilities by Google (material.io).
  # Used to compute and create Tonal Palette theme colors.
  # Flutter SDK from 2.10.0 stable also uses and depends on this package.
  #
  # Use ^0.1.3 for Flutter stable 2.10.x, that uses 0.1.3
  # Use ^0.1.3 for Flutter stable 3.0.x, that uses 0.1.4.
  # Use ^0.1.3 for Flutter rel candidates 3.1, 3.2, 3.4, that uses 0.1.5, beware that
  # version 0.1.5 has a new faster algo compared to 0.1.4 that changes some seed colors slightly.
  # Use ^0.2.0 for Flutter master 3.1.0-x, that uses 0.2.0 after 5.8.2022.
  #
  # This is an unusual range since 0.2.0 is a breaking semver step over 0.1.x, but it works for this
  # case, and was also observed as range used by Google package dynamic_color.
